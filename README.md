# ML_Project-Solar_Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction

This project delves into the world of underwater object identification using machine learning. Here, we focus on logistic regression to classify objects detected by sonar as rocks or mines based on the sonar data they produce.

### Project Overview

This project utilizes logistic regression, a powerful algorithm for binary classification, to analyze sonar readings and predict whether the object is a rock or a mine. The dataset contains various features extracted from sonar signals, and the model will learn to distinguish between these two categories based on these features.

###  Data

The project utilizes a dataset containing sonar readings of rocks and mines. This dataset is typically a CSV file with features representing different aspects of the sonar signal and a final column indicating the classification (R - Rock, M - Mine). 

###  Running the Project

The main script (`main.py` or similar) typically follows these steps:

1. **Load the data:** Load the sonar dataset using appropriate libraries.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for modeling. This might involve handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and potentially encoding categorical features (if present).
3. **Split Data:** Divide the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the logistic regression model, and the testing set evaluates its performance on unseen data.
4. **Model Training:** Train the logistic regression model on the training data.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. 
6. **(Optional) Model Saving:**  Save the trained model for future use.

###  Additional Notes

* This project demonstrates using logistic regression for sonar rock and mine prediction. You can explore other machine learning models for comparison.
* Consider including data visualization techniques to explore the sonar features and their distribution between rocks and mines.
* Feel free to modify the code and explore functionalities like making predictions on new sonar data.
